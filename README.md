Overview
This project aims to enhance low-light images using the Weighted Thresholded Histogram Equalization (WTHE) method. Low-light images often suffer from poor visibility and lack of details, making it challenging for various computer vision tasks. The WTHE method enhances such images by redistributing pixel intensities while preserving important image characteristics.
